This is a simple todo list written in C# for the .NET Framework 4.0. The WPF user interface is implemented using the MVVM pattern and Caliburn Micro. 

Todo items are persisted in a local SQL Server Compact 4.0 database using Entity Framework Code First. SQL Server Compact is an in-process database engine that requires no installation routine or any special privileges on the client.
